Hello! 
Thank you for buying!


Here is small instruction:

Please, use Prefabs from DestructibleProps/Prefabs_destructible folder. Or you can find indestructible objects it Prefabs_indestructible forlder.

All objects can be broken by 2 ways:

1)By weapon;
2)By falling.

The weapon system realised in my scripts is the one of possible, because you can have another weapon system in you project, I have done only demo weapon system. The script BulletDemage.cs has only one variable that subtracted from Health variable in the destruction.cs script when the bullet collides with the destructible object.


Thank you again!
