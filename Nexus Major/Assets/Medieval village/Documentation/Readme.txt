I deleted Unity Standard Assets from package but to achieve same visual as in video please do next:

1. Import Post Processing Stack from asset store and use "FantVillage" file as Post-Processing Profile. 
   you can find it in the package under "Post Profiles" folder.
   Medieval village\Post Profiles\FantVillage

2. For the water import Unity Standard Assets and use Water4Advanced prefab. 
   Drag and drop Water4Advanced prefab on the scene and set:
   position on  X-478 Y-22.6 Z-445
   Scale  X-15 Y-1 Z-15
